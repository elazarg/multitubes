# Finite linear-inequality compatibility

This file transports the Fourier--Motzkin theorem of alternatives from
`Fin (Fintype.card State)` to an arbitrary finite state type.

For finitely many vectors `delta action` and lower bounds `base action`,
exactly one of the following is possible:

* one potential pairs with every vector above its lower bound;
* nonnegative action weights balance every coordinate of the vectors and
  have strictly positive weighted lower bound.

The final theorem records the sign information supplied by a Bellman
residual inequality.

## Main definitions

* `Maths.finiteInequalityMatrix`: the row data transported along the canonical
  equivalence `State ≃ Fin (Fintype.card State)`, which is what lets the `Fin`-indexed
  Fourier--Motzkin theorem apply to an arbitrary finite state type.

## Main results

* `Maths.exists_potential_or_nonnegative_incompatibility`: the theorem of
  alternatives - either one potential meets every lower bound, or a nonnegative balanced
  dependence among the rows has strictly positive weighted lower bound.
* `Maths.not_nonnegative_incompatibility_of_potential`: the two alternatives
  exclude each other.
* `Maths.exists_potential_iff_no_nonnegative_incompatibility`: the two combined as
  an equivalence.  This is the form other files use.
* `Maths.exists_potential_or_bellmanResidual_obstruction`: under the residual
  hypothesis `base action + level action ≤ 0`, the failing branch additionally yields strictly
  negative weighted level and one positively weighted action of positive base.

## References

  Fourier--Motzkin elimination and the Farkas theorems of the alternative.
